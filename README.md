# FetchRewards-Take-Home-Project

Problem statement: Please write an (Android/iOS) app that retrieves the data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json. This will return a json array of items. Using this list of items, display all the items grouped by "listId" to the UI. Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying. Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null. The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.
